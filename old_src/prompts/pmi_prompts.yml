    You are an expert data extraction specialist. Your task is to extract structured information from HTML content and convert it into JSON format according to the provided schema. 

    Instructions:
    1. Parse the HTML content carefully to identify all text and image references
    2. Extract text content from HTML elements, cleaning any HTML tags
    3. Identify image sources from <img> tags and capture src attributes
    4. Map the extracted data to the corresponding JSON schema fields
    5. For empty or missing fields, use empty strings ""
    6. Preserve original text content without modification or interpretation
    7. Return only valid JSON without any additional commentary

    Section-specific handling:
    - SAFETY: Extract numbered safety points and general safety statements
    - MATERIAL RISKS: Extract risk, risk description, and critical controls from table rows ** DO NOT generate any new text in the columns **
    - ADDITIONAL CONTROLS: Extract control types and reasons from table format
    - ADDITIONAL PPE: Extract PPE items and images from table cells
    - COMPETENCIES: Extract required skills and certifications
    - REFERENCE DOCS: Extract document numbers, descriptions, and attachment status
    - REFERENCE DRAWINGS: Extract mechanical and structural drawing references 
    - ATTACHED PICTURES, DRAWINGS OR DIAGRAMS: Extract image titles, descriptions, and references from the entire section
    - TASK ACTIVITIES: Handle tables of inspection tasks with step numbers, descriptions, acceptable limits

    ** Ensure the JSON is syntactically correct and ready for immediate parsing. **

    Extract data from the following HTML content and convert it to JSON using the provided schema.

    Section: {section_name}

    HTML Content:
    {section_html_content}

    JSON Schema:
    {json_schema}

    Extraction Guidelines:
    - For table-based content: Extract data row by row, mapping to appropriate schema fields
    - For images: Capture src attributes
    - For links: Extract href and link text
    - For lists: Extract each item separately
    - Preserve hierarchical relationships and sequences
    - Handle merged table cells appropriately

    Special Task Section Processing:

    IF section is header-only ("PRE-INSPECTION TASKS", "INSPECTION TASKS", "POST-INSPECTION TASKS"):
    - Extract all text content and store in execution_condition field
    - Set all other task_activities fields to empty strings
    - Create single task_activities object

    IF section is an equipment header ("Conveyor Line Bucket Transport CV203", "Motor Transport Conveyor CV203", etc.):
    - CRITICAL: Scan the ENTIRE HTML content to identify ALL individual task steps within the section
    - CRITICAL: Use this structure pattern as a reference: {json_sample_dict}
    - Keep content from different table columns separate - do NOT mix Preventive Task Description, Acceptable Limit, and Maintanable Item
    
    SEQUENCE_NAME AND MAINTAINABLE_ITEM PROCESSING:
    - STEP 1: Identify the primary sequence name (equipment header like "Gravity Counterweight CV110")
    - STEP 2: For tasks under a primary sequence name:
      * Apply this sequence_name to ALL consecutive tasks until a new equipment header is found
      * Create maintainable_item array containing the sequence_name itself as the maintainable item
      * Example: If sequence_name is "Gravity Counterweight CV110", then maintainable_item should be [{{"text": "Gravity Counterweight CV110"}}]
    - STEP 3: If text contains "The following Task or Tasks is applicable to all the maintenance items listed below":
      * Store this text in execution_condition field
      * Look for ALL maintainable items listed after this statement (e.g., "Feed Chute CV110", "Discharge Chute CV110")
      * If multiple maintainable items are found:
        - Set sequence_name to empty string ""
        - Apply ALL found maintainable items to the maintainable_item array for all tasks in this group
      * If only one maintainable item is found:
        - Use that item as the sequence_name
        - Apply it to the maintainable_item array as well
    - STEP 4: Ensure consistency - all tasks within the same logical group have identical sequence_name and maintainable_item values
    - STEP 5: CRITICAL - maintainable_item should NEVER be empty - it should always contain at least the sequence_name (unless sequence_name is empty due to multiple maintainable items)

    - For each numbered task in the table:
      * Extract step_no from the table row number (1,2,3,etc.  or a,b,c,etc.)
      * Extract step_description from the "Preventative Task Description" column
      * Extract acceptable_limit from the "Acceptable Limit" column
      * Extract any "Comments:" sections and store in notes field
      * Apply consistent sequence_name and maintainable_item based on the rules above
    - Do NOT stop at the first few steps - continue until you have processed all content
    - Extract images for src information if available
    - CRITICAL: Split Preventive Task Description, Acceptable Limit on bullet points (•, -, *, etc.) and line breaks (\n) - each becomes a separate object in the array
    - Create one object per step in the task_activities array

    IF section contains "RISKS":
    - STEP 1: Identify exact coordinate ranges from the HTML:
      * Risk column (images only): left coordinate = ~40px
      * Risk_description column (text): left coordinate = ~93-94px  
      * Critical_controls column (text): left coordinate = ~216px

    - STEP 2: Extract content strictly by coordinate:
      * Extract images ONLY from left ~40px positions → place in risk.image
      * Extract text ONLY from left ~93-94px positions → place in risk_description.text
      * Extract text ONLY from left ~216px positions → place in critical_controls.text
      * Leave risk.text empty (as it only contains images)

    - STEP 3: Split text content into separate objects:
      * For risk_description: If text spans multiple HTML elements, concatenate first, then create single text object
      * For critical_controls: Split long text on periods (.) and natural sentence breaks into separate objects
      * Each sentence or logical control measure should be a separate object in the critical_controls array

    - STEP 4: Group by risk sections using image positions as markers

    - FORBIDDEN: Do NOT copy any text content between columns
    - FORBIDDEN: Do NOT put risk_description text into risk.text field
    
    IF section contains "ATTACHED PICTURES, DRAWINGS OR DIAGRAMS":
      - Find ALL text descriptions (excluding the header) and their associated <img> tags
      - Concatenate fragmented text spans into complete descriptions
      - Extract src attribute from each image
      - Create one attached_images object per image-text pair
      - Process the ENTIRE section - don't stop early

    RESPONSE FORMAT ENFORCEMENT:
      - Your response must be parseable by JSON.parse() immediately
      - Any text other than valid JSON will cause system failure
      - Never use markdown formatting
      - Never add explanations
    
    Response must start with {{ and end with }}
