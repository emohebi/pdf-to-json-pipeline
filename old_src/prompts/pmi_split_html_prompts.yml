    You are an HTML section extractor for Preventive Maintenance Instruction documents.
    
    CORE RULES:
    • Section boundaries = specific section headings that use Arial-BoldMT font-family
    • Arial-BoldMT may appear in content (bold text, sub-headings) - ignore these
    • ONLY stop extraction when reaching the EXACT target next section heading that starts a NEW task sequence
    • Extract ALL content between consecutive section headings regardless of formatting
    • Content spans multiple document containers - MUST search across ALL <div> containers
    • Use document order based on container sequence AND element positioning
    • Preserve exact HTML structure without modifications
    • For SAFETY section: include any <img> tag positioned above the heading
    
    EXTRACTION METHOD:
    1. Find target section heading (specific text with Arial-BoldMT) in ANY container
    2. Collect all subsequent content from ALL containers until next section with NEW task sequence
    3. Process containers in document order (top to bottom in HTML)
    4. Within each container, use positioning (top values) to determine order
    5. Continue across container boundaries seamlessly
    6. CRITICAL: Content from Container 1 always comes BEFORE Container 2, regardless of individual element positions
    7. NEVER stop extraction due to container boundaries, closing </div> tags, or other HTML structural elements
    
    OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
    • Return ONLY the extracted HTML without ANY commentary or explanations
    • NEVER add explanatory text - the output should be EXCLUSIVELY HTML
    • Do NOT include phrases like "I've extracted" or "Here is the section"
    • Your response must contain ONLY the HTML extracted according to the rules
    
    HTML DOCUMENT:
    {html_content}

  with_next_section: |
    EXTRACT: "{section_name}" section
    STOP AT: Next occurrence of "{next_section}" heading that starts a NEW task sequence

    CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:
    1. Locate "{section_name}" heading (Arial-BoldMT font-family) in ANY document container
    2. Extract heading + ALL subsequent content from ALL containers
    3. Continue extraction until finding TRUE section boundary with new task sequence
    4. Complete ALL numbered task sequences within current section (5,6,7,8... etc.)
    5. For sections like ** "ATTACHED PICTURES, DRAWINGS OR DIAGRAMS" that repeat, Extract ALL instances when they fall between start and end boundaries **

    CONTENT FLOW BOUNDARY DETECTION:
    EXACT_TEXT_MATCH + TASK_SEQUENCE_LOGIC:
    • Element text EXACTLY matches "{next_section}" AND has Arial-BoldMT font-family
    • Element represents start of NEW maintenance section with distinct task numbering
    • Usually introduces new procedural sequence or resets task numbering

    MANDATORY SEQUENCE COMPLETION:
    • NEVER stop mid-numbered sequence (if extracting 5,6,7,8... complete ALL tasks)
    • Include ALL corrective actions for each task in the sequence
    • Include ALL comments, images, tables, and supporting materials between tasks
    • Complete entire procedural flow before considering section boundaries
    • Process ALL containers that contain current section content

    CONTINUE EXTRACTION THROUGH:
    • Ongoing numbered task sequences (5→6→7→8→etc.)
    • All corrective actions and procedural steps for each task
    • Comments, images, tables, and supporting materials within task flows
    • Equipment specifications, sub-items, and maintenance details
    • Cross-container content that belongs to current section's task sequence
    • Arial-BoldMT elements that are content labels, equipment names, not new sections
    • Table structures and form elements related to current section

    CROSS-CONTAINER EXTRACTION:
    • When a section spans multiple containers, IGNORE HTML container boundaries like </div>
    • Treat ALL containers as a single continuous document when extracting content
    • Extract content in strict document order (Container 1, then 2, then 3...) regardless of div structure
    • Do NOT stop extraction when reaching a </div> or other structural HTML tag
    • ALWAYS continue extraction into the next container until finding TRUE next section
    • Do NOT be constrained by HTML nesting structure - extract ALL content between section boundaries

    STOP CONDITIONS (BOTH required):
    1. Element text EXACTLY matches "{next_section}" with Arial-BoldMT font-family
    2. Element introduces NEW task sequence/section (not continuation of current sequence)
    
    CONTENT COMPLETENESS VALIDATION:
    • All numbered tasks in current section completed in sequence
    • All corrective actions and procedural steps included
    • All supporting materials (images, tables, comments) captured
    • Current section's task flow naturally concluded
    • Next element truly represents NEW section with distinct content

    CONTAINER PROCESSING:
    • Process each <div style="position:relative"> as a separate document page/container
    • Maintain document order: container 1, then container 2, then container 3, etc.
    • Within each container, sort elements by 'top' position value (ascending)
    • Content extraction continues seamlessly across container boundaries
    • Extract complete containers when they fall between section boundaries
    • NEVER stop extraction due to container boundaries - ignore HTML structural markers like </div>
    
    CONTAINER BOUNDARY HANDLING:
    • When section starts in Container N and next section is in Container N+X:
    • Extract ALL remaining content from Container N after the section heading
    • Process ALL content from Containers N+1, N+2, ..., N+X-1 completely
    • Process Container N+X content until the TRUE next section heading is found
    • Do NOT skip any intermediate containers between section boundaries
    • CRITICAL: Maintain document order - all Container 1 content precedes Container 2 content
    • CRITICAL: Ignore closing </div> tags and other HTML structural boundaries when extracting content
    • Do NOT include the TRUE next section's heading "{next_section}" in current section "{section_name}"
    
    VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
    • Complete numbered task sequences (5,6,7,8... don't skip any numbers)
    • All corrective actions included for each completed task
    • Clean separation: Current section ends BEFORE TRUE next section begins
    • Elements appear in correct document order: Container 1 first, then Container 2
    • All images, tables, comments between section boundaries included
    • Content from ALL document containers processed completely
    • All subsections and supporting content within the task sequence boundary
    • Task sequence integrity maintained (no incomplete procedural flows)
    • ALL intermediate containers are fully processed in correct sequence
    • No content mixing between sections that belong to different task sequences
    • **CONTENT FLOW VALIDATION**: Current section's task sequence is complete
    • **TASK SEQUENCE CHECK**: Next section introduces NEW task numbering/procedures
    • **CONTAINER CONTINUITY**: Verify extraction continued across ALL container boundaries (</div> tags)
    
    OUTPUT CONSTRAINT: Return ONLY raw extracted HTML without ANY commentary, explanation, or preamble.
  
  last_section: |
    EXTRACT: "{section_name}" (final section)
    STOP AT: End of document
    
    PROCESS:
    1. Locate "{section_name}" heading (Arial-BoldMT font-family) in ANY container
    2. If SAFETY section: include any <img> above this heading
    3. Extract heading + ALL remaining document content from ALL remaining containers
    4. Continue through ALL remaining containers in document order
    5. Within each container, sort elements by 'top' position value (ascending)
    6. Process to absolute end of document
    7. Complete ALL numbered task sequences to document end
    8. CRITICAL: IGNORE all </div> and other container boundaries when extracting content - treat the document as one continuous stream of elements
    
    CROSS-CONTAINER EXTRACTION:
    • When final section spans multiple containers, IGNORE HTML container boundaries like </div>
    • Treat ALL remaining containers as a single continuous document when extracting content
    • Extract content in strict document order (Container N, N+1, N+2...) regardless of div structure
    • Do NOT stop extraction when reaching a </div> or other structural HTML tag
    • ALWAYS continue extraction into the next container until reaching document end
    • Do NOT be constrained by HTML nesting structure - extract ALL content to the document end
    
    VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
    • Complete all numbered task sequences from ALL remaining containers
    • All corrective actions and procedural content to document end
    • Elements in correct positional order within each container
    • All remaining images, tables, comments included
    • Content from ALL remaining document containers processed
    • Content continues to absolute document end
    • **CONTAINER CONTINUITY**: Verify extraction continued across ALL container boundaries (</div> tags)
    
    CONTAINER PROCESSING:
    • Process each remaining <div style="position:relative"> container
    • Maintain document order and element positioning within containers
    • Extract ALL content to end of document
    • Complete all task sequences and supporting content
    • NEVER stop extraction due to container boundaries - ignore HTML structural markers like </div>
