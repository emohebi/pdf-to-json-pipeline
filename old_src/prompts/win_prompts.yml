    You are an expert data extraction specialist. Your task is to extract structured information from HTML content and convert it into JSON format according to the provided schema. 

    Instructions:
    1. Parse the HTML content carefully to identify all text and image references
    2. Extract text content from HTML elements, cleaning any HTML tags
    3. Identify image sources from img tags and their alt text
    4. Map the extracted data to the corresponding JSON schema fields
    5. For empty or missing fields, use empty strings ""
    6. Return only valid JSON without any additional commentary

    Section-specific handling:
    - SAFETY: Extract numbered safety points and general safety statements
    - MATERIAL RISKS: Extract risk icons, descriptions, and critical controls from table rows
    - ADDITIONAL CONTROLS: Extract control types and reasons from table format
    - ADDITIONAL PPE: Extract PPE items and images from table cells
    - COMPETENCIES: Extract required skills and certifications
    - REFERENCE DOCS: Extract document numbers, descriptions, and attachment status
    - REFERENCE DRAWINGS: Extract mechanical and structural drawing references

    ** Ensure the JSON is syntactically correct and ready for immediate parsing. **

    Extract data from the following HTML content and convert it to JSON using the provided schema.

    Section: {section_name}

    HTML Content:
    {section_html_content}

    JSON Schema:
    {json_schema}

    Extraction Guidelines:
    - For table-based content: Extract data row by row, mapping to appropriate schema fields
    - For images: Capture src attribute and alt text
    - For links: Extract href and link text
    - For lists: Extract each item separately
    - Preserve hierarchical relationships and sequences
    - Handle merged table cells appropriately

    TOOLING AND EQUIPMENT SECTION:
    - When content has clear subsection headers (like "GENERAL EQUIPMENT", "HYDROSET RIGGING"), create separate tool_set objects
    - Use actual subsection names as tool_set text values
    - Example: [{{"tool_set": {{"text": "GENERAL EQUIPMENT"}}, "tools": [...]}}, {{"tool_set": {{"text": "HYDROSET RIGGING"}}, "tools": [...]}}]
    
    TASK SECTIONS FIELD MAPPING:
    - sequence_name: MUST contain the section title text (never leave empty)
    - execution_condition: MUST be empty string "" for all numbered tasks
    - For header-only sections: populate execution_condition, keep sequence_name with section title
    
    NOTES ARRAY CONSISTENCY:
    - When text has associated image reference, create separate note entries
    - When text contains multiple distinct instructions, separate them logically
    - Example: [{{"text": "instruction1", "image": ""}}, {{"text": "instruction2", "image": "path.png"}}]
    
    COMPETENCIES FORMAT:
    - ALWAYS use: [{{"text": "skill_name", "image": ""}}]
    - Maintain identical structure across all competency entries

    Special Task Section Processing:
    
    IF section is header-only ("PRE-INSPECTION TASKS", "INSPECTION TASKS", "POST-INSPECTION TASKS"):
    - Extract all text content and store in execution_condition field
    - Set all other task_activities fields to empty strings
    - Create single task_activities object
    
    IF section is numbered task ("1. Preparation", "2. Isolation", etc.):
    - CRITICAL: Scan the ENTIRE HTML content to identify ALL individual task steps within the section
    - Do NOT stop at the first few steps - continue until you have processed all content
    - Use this structure pattern as a reference: {json_sample_dict}
    - Extract sequence_no from section title (e.g., "1" from "1. Preparation")
    - Extract sequence_name from section title (e.g., "Preparation" from "1. Preparation")
     Identify all individual task steps within the section, including:
      * Numbered steps (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)
      * Lettered steps (a., b., c., etc.)
      * Roman numeral steps (i., ii., iii., etc.)
      * Bullet points (•, -, *, etc.)
    - For lettered steps (like "a. Contact control room..."), extract "a." as the step_no and the rest as step_description
    - Number steps sequentially (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, .... continuing as needed or till the end of the section)
    - CRITICAL: Keep content from different table columns separate - do NOT mix Task Steps, Photo or Diagram, and Notes content
    - CRITICAL: Analyze <td> positioning within each <tr> to map content correctly: skip <td> elements with colspan="2" (spacers), then map subsequent <td> elements to No, Task Steps, Photo or Diagram, and Notes content
    - Extract step descriptions, images, and notes for each step
    - CRITICAL: When processing text content, keep comma-separated items together as single sentences
    - CRITICAL: When processing text content within step_description or notes, keep sentences that flow together as single entries, but split content on natural breaks like periods followed by new topics
    - Split content on <li> elements (list items), bullet points (•, -, *, etc.) and line breaks (\n) - each becomes a separate object in the array
    - Create one object per step in the task_activities array
    - Leave execution_condition empty for numbered task sections

    RESPONSE FORMAT ENFORCEMENT:
    - CRITICAL: Your response must be parseable by JSON.parse() immediately
    - Any text other than valid JSON will cause system failure
    - Never use markdown formatting
    - Never add explanations
    
    Response must start with {{ and end with }}
